    <h2><b>Introduction to HTML</b></h2>

    <p>
      HTML (<i>Hypertext Markup Language</i>) is used to create document on the
      <u>World Wide Web</u>. It is simply a collection of certain key words
      called <q>Tags</q> that are helpful in writing the
      <i>document to be displayed using a browser on Internet</i>. HTML was
      developed by <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> in 1992.
